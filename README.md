## Information

We participated in this College JAM with the "**Permanent Change**" as a theme.

Our game was a train in constant movement that had to cross the country connecting the most possible towns.


## My Part

I was the lead programmer of the team and, along with another member, we created the programming part of the team.

## Game

The game, as told earlier, is a moving train that has to connect all the towns in the map. <br>

To clarify, this is what a Town looks like: <br>
![Town](/res/town.png)

Once the tracks connect all the towns in the map, the level is completed and the player can go to the next one.

**The gameplay is simple:**

There is the train: <br>
![Train](/res/train.png)<br>
and the players has to place the tracks available to him/her arround the train but remember, the clock is ticking!

The available tracks are: <br> 
![Coss](/res/cross.png)
![Down](/res/down.png)
![Line](/res/line.png)
<br> or rotations of those.


The player only has one track at a time to place so he/she must place the useless ones out of the way of the train.
